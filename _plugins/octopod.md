This plugin sends immediate push notifications to your iOS devices or [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/home) when:
1. Print finished (includes camera snapshot) or at specific progress percentages
1. Print reached specified layers (requires [DisplayLayerProgress plugin](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/DisplayLayerProgress/))
1. Bed warmed up to target temp for a period of time. Helps get smooth first layers
1. Bed cooled down below specified threshold. Ideal to easily remove prints from bed
1. Extruder cooled down below specified threshold. Ideal to know when to turn printer off
1. Printer paused for user. This may happen when running out of filament or when doing manual multi color printing (M600)
1. [Palette 2 / Pro](https://www.mosaicmfg.com/products/palette-2) encountered a problem while printing
1. [MMU](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/upgrades/183-original-prusa-i3-mk25smk3s-multi-material-2s-upgrade-kit-mmu2s.html#) requires user assistance (requires Prusa firmware)
1. Firmware errors. Get security alerts like thermal runaway, probing failed, min temp error, max temp error, etc.


If you are using the free and open source [OctoPod](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/octopod-for-octoprint/id1412557625?mt=8)
to control your printer from any iOS device then this plugin is a great addition. If you
never heard of [OctoPod](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/octopod-for-octoprint/id1412557625?mt=8)
before then you are in for a treat. Here are some of its features: multiple printers support,
multiple cameras support including full screen with zoom in/out, control your printer using
Siri, your Apple Watch or your Apple TV, temperature charts including temp variance. You can cancel any object
being printed since it has support for [Cancel object plugin](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/cancelobject/).
But that is not the only supported plugin, here are other supported plugins: [TPLink](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/tplinksmartplug/),
[PSU Control](https://github.com/kantlivelong/OctoPrint-PSUControl), [Domoticz](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/domoticz/),
[Belkin Wemo](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/wemoswitch/), [Tasmota](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/tasmota/) and
[Custom Control ](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/customControl/). And now with this new
OctoPrint plugin we added real time notifications for some very useful features.
